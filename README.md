# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m Jason

I have a background in data analysis, but I've always had a great curiosity for programming and its usefulness in tech and problem solving! My curiosity led to me teaching myself how to code in my spare time. This account is basically just a record of all my work and a portfolio of sorts.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python for data analysis and javascript/html/css for front end web development
